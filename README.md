# College-Textbook-Website

I created a website for college students to sell their textbooks to other college students. The website can be found at https://takoda.online/

For the front-end I leveraged Twitter Bootstrap, and also made the website mobile friendly with a collapsable navigation bar. I used PHP and OAuth2.0 to create a way for users to register/login with their Google account. MySQL is the database management system I use to store all of the textbooks, and user accounts.
